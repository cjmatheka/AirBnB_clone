This is exactly as it sounds, an airBnB clone. 

### What is Airbnb?  
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people seeking short-term accommodations with hosts who offer rooms, apartments, or entire homes for rent.  It revolutionized the travel and hospitality industry with its peer-to-peer model.

### Core Features of an Airbnb Clone
An Airbnb clone would aim to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform.  These features generally include:

#### Listing Management:
+ Creating Listings: Hosts can create detailed listings for their properties, including descriptions, photos, pricing,
  availability, and house rules.
+ Search and Filtering: Potential guests can search for accommodations based on location, dates, number of guests, 
  amenities, and price.   
#### Booking System:
+ Availability Calendar: Hosts maintain availability calendars and guests can see if a place is available on their 
desired dates.
+ Booking Requests and Confirmation: Guests can submit booking requests and hosts can either approve or decline those 
  requests.
+ Secure Payment Processing: The platform handles bookings and secure payments.   
#### User Profiles:
+ Both Guests and Hosts: The system maintains user profiles for both guests and hosts, including information, contact 
details (often limited) and verification status.
#### Reviews and Ratings System:
+ Two-Way Reviews Guests and hosts can rate and review each other based on their experiences. This fosters trust and 
accountability on the platform.
+ Messaging System: Guests and hosts can communicate to clarify details or ask questions before, during, and after a 
  booking.

### What is an Airbnb Clone Interpreter?  
The Airbnb clone interpreter is designed to be a command-line interface specifically for managing the data and objects relevant to your Airbnb-like application. This likely includes things like:

+ Users: Creating, modifying, and deleting user information.
+ Places: Adding, updating, and removing rental listings.
+ Reviews: Managing and viewing reviews associated with places.
+ Bookings: Creating and handling booking data.
